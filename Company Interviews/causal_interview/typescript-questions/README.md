### Coding Challenge Guidelines

See the `spec` files under the `src` directory for the use cases that need to be implemented. TODO notes in the code also provide pointers on functionality.

Each problem is independent and can be submitted as you're progressing; you're encouraged to use granular commits showing progress, as you see fit.

### Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run watch`

#### Optional

- `npm run start` - run the react app in browser
- `npm run format` - format code based on the provided prettier settings

### Evaluation Criteria

Use your time wisely to try and resolve all of the test cases. Bonus problems are identified by the skipped tests, and should be completed only **after** the main functionality is done.

Please organize, design, test, and document code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the master branch before the timer runs out.

Have fun coding! ðŸš€
