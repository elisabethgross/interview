/**
 * Find permutations of s within b
 *
 * Most people get the brute force which is extremely slow with a bad bottleneck -> O(s factorial) === BAD
 *
 * Make an example
 *
 * Example s: abbc
 * Example b: babcabbacaabcbabcabb
 *
 * She says something about looping and iterating and same length s and b and iterating b + 1
 * Investigate
